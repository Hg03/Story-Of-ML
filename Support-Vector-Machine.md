## Support Vector Machine Intuition

**Support Vector Machine** ⛷️ is a Supervised Machine Learning Classification algorithm which helps to classify different classes (labels) using **hyperplane** ✈️. Support Vector machine mainly chooses the optimal hyperplane with max **margin** distance from **support ⚇ vectors** ⚇. Let's make it more clear below :

### How it is implemented 🤔 💭

Imagine you have a data with 2 classes i.e. blue 🔵 and red 🔴, we will separate these classes using hyperplane. Hyperplane can be one-dimensional (separated by point), two-dimensional plane (separated by line), three-dimensional (separated by plane or circle) or more higher dimensional hyperplane.
