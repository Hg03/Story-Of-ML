## Linear Regression Intuition 

**Linear Regression** ðŸ“ˆ is a type of **Supervised** Machine Learning model which tries to fit the line âšŸ (in terms of X-Y Plane) or a plane ðŸ›¬ (in terms of X-Y-Z Plane) or any higher dimensional linear entity to a data such that It can properly predict the future values. Linear Regression helps to predict the continuous value, hence it is a regression problem.

### How it is implemented ðŸ¤” ðŸ’­

Imagine you have a data as below

|Year|Price|
|----|-----|
|1985|0.50|
|1986|0.50|
|1987|0.52|
|1988|0.56|
|1989|0.53|
|1990|0.56|
|1991|0.65|
|1992|0.52|
|..|..|
|..|..|
|..|..|

and so on..

We can plot the data as below..
