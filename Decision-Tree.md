## Decision Tree Intuition

**Decision Tree** üå≥ is very popular Supervised Machine Learning Algorithm which creates tree and every node is known as **Decision node** or **Condition node** and leaf node results to predicting the target class (or any continuous value). This algorithm can be used both for regression and classification tasks. Let's look into it that how Decision Tree is built :

### How it is implemented ?? ü§î ‚òÅÔ∏è

**Terminology -**
1. **Root Node** - It represents entire population or sample and it further gets divided into sub-nodes. It is the initial node of a tree.
2. **Splitting** - It is a process of dividing a node into further sub nodes.
3. **Decision Node** - When sub-nodes splits into a further sub nodes, it is decision nodes.
4. **Leaf/Terminal Node** - When node is pure or it can't be split further.
5. **Pruning** - When we remove sub-nodes , this process is known as pruning of decision tree.
